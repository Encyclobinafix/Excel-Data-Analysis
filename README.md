## **Introduction**

This is an Excel project on the analysis of medical students' data. This project aims to use pivot tables and pivot charts to show trends in a medical student data and provide useful insights on the data to stakeholders.

### _Step 1_: 
The medical student dataset was cleaned and filtered. There were missing data in several rows. The "find and replace" functionality was used to find the averages of numerical values and these were used to fill in the blanks. Also, for columns with text data, specific instructions were given on what to replace the blanks with and this was effecctively done.

### _Step 2_: 
Using the pivot table and charts functionalities, the the following insights and visualizations were created.

1. Comparing and visualizing the average vitals value for male and females. This visualization shows the differences in the age, BMI, temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels for male and female medical students.
